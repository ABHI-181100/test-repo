<p class="headings">Introduction</p>
- AMaR pr Autonomous Multi-utility Rover is an affordable Robotic System that can substitute human interference in potentially hazardous scenarios.
- In the current global pandemic of "COVID-19", AMaR can prove tp be a blessing for the health care agencies.
- It is an "Autonomous machine - This bot is capable of analysing the path ahead of itself and deciding the best way to manuover across.
- AMaR is a very versatile platform whose scope spans across a multitude of potential fields. AMaR boasts many features that enable it to adapt to many complex situations, where, till now, humans had no option but to get involved first handed.
- AMaR is primarily designed keeping in mind it's potential applications in Medical Field. This robot will learn and adapt with it's surroundings. The autonomous capabilities that we plan to achieve with this project may lead a way to a robotic workforce that we can forward as agents in many situations that are unfavourable for us human otherwise.
- AMaR can be directly applied as a nursing assistant (non-medical) in a hospital environment-where patients are required to be isolated. This claim is based on the flexible design strategies that have been followed all across it's planning process.
